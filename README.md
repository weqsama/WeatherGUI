# WeatherGUI

This project is my solution for the second option on the Take Home Kata Guidelines sheet. It is an interactive weather app that allows the user to search for a city, view current weather information (temperature, humidity, daily high/low, wind speed, and cloud conditions), and compare weather information from two cities.

Creating this project was an excellent learning experience as this is the first time I've interacted with these technologies besides Python.

*Functionality*:
- Search for current weather data by city
- Compare the weather of two cities side by side
- Displays weather details (temperature, humidity, daily high/low, wind speed, cloud conditions)
- Change units (imperial, metric, and international systems)

*Technologies Used*:
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **PyQt6** (GUI Library)
- **Requests** (HTTP Request Library)
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (Weather Data)

*Future Improvements*:
- Add more detailed error handling for invalid input
- Improve UI responsiveness for various window sizes
- Extended forecasts
- Color coded comparisons
